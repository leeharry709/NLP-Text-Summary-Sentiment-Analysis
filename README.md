# NLP-Text-Summary-Sentiment-Analysis

## Introduction
This is a streamlit application that takes user input text and outputs a summary, sentiment (polarity and subjectivity), and top 10 keywords. This is a simple showcase of utilizing huggingface transformers to run natural language processing (NLP) in multiple ways.

Pegasus is a pre-trained transformer model developed by Google AI for text summarization, built on top of the BART (Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformers) architecture. Pegasus uses a masked language modeling (MLM) objective to pre-train, which involves randomly masking some of the words in a sentence and then predicting the missing words. What is unique with the output of Pegasus is that the model generates a completely new summary whereas other models use sentences within the input text to generate a summary.

The image shows the summary, keywords, and sentiment of the introductory paragraph of the Google AI blog post: [PEGASUS: A State-of-the-Art Model for Abstractive Text Summarization](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/pegasus-state-of-art-model-for.html).

The keywords are generated by the yake library. It uses 5 factors to generate the score for each keyword: Word frequency, length, position, relatedness to context, and difference between sentences. Those 5 factors are the combined to give a single score for each keyword. The lower the score, the more relevant the keyword is considered to be.

The sentiment is calculated by TextBlob, a python library with a variety of tools for NLP tasks including sentiment analysis. The sentiment() function in TextBlob has two properties: Polarity and subjectivity. Polarity is a float between -1 and 1 that indicates positive (+1) vs negative (-1) sentiment. A polarity of 0 indicates neutral sentiment. Subjectivity is a float between 0 and 1 that indicates how subjective (0) or opinionative (1) the input text is.

## Conclusions
Based on the results of the analysis, the Google AI blog post of Pegasus model is shown to be slightly positively sentimented and neither fully subjective nor opnionative. While this is only a simple showcase of NLP, there is a lot of inferences we can pull from the results. This is a blog post by Google talking about their own product, so we can expect to see some positive and objective bias, but the introduction still remained faily neutral. With more text, there would be more accurate scores regarding the entire paper. But, these initial scores tell us that there is good information to be gleamed from the blog post without significant bias.

## Real-World Application
Text summarization, sentiment, and keyword extraction are all very essential to everyday life already. All three methods of NLP are used in search engines to show users before they click on the link what they are expecting in the website. The keywords can help users find what they are looking for without typing out the exact phrases or title of the webpage, the summarization can tell them briefly what the page is about before fully clicking on them (and inadvertantly avoiding spam or malware sites), and the sentiment can filter out search results that are too polarizing and opinionated. Optimization of NLP will allow users to live more efficient and productive lives.
